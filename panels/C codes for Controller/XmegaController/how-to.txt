How-to info on compiling and loading the panel controller firmware

1) Install WinAVR: 
    download http://sourceforge.net/projects/winavr/files/WinAVR/20090313/WinAVR-20090313-install.exe/download
    install
    make sure C:\WinAVR-20090313\bin and C:\WinAVR-200903013\utils\bin are added to the Path system variable
  
2) Compile the code:
    open up a command console
    cd to the directory where the panelcontroller code is located
    type make
  
3) download the hex file
    connect the panelcontroller box to the pc via USB cable
    (this will trigger the download of the USB serial driver if not already loaded)
    goto the Device Manager on the PC and identify the COM port used by the USB serial driver
    edit the flash.bat file and change the avrdude port argument to the correct port (default is -P COM5)
    turn on the panel controller hardware, the rightmost LED will turn on
    within 3 seconds doubleclick the flash.bat icon, this should open up a command window and the hex file will be downloaded
  
4) connect to the panel controller using some terminal software (e.g. hyperterminal)
    start up the terninal software
    create a new connection, set the port to the USB serial port, configure to port to 115200 baud, 8 data bits, no parity, no flow control
    power-up the controller - after the 3 sec bootloader delay the controller should send a wake-up message to the PC
    the second LED from left will be on during the FS mounting then blick 4 times to indicate the controller is alive and running
